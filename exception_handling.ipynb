        "1 . What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "In interpreted languages, the code is executed line by line by an interpreter (e.g., Python). In compiled languages, the entire program is translated into machine code before execution (e.g., C, C++).\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Interpreted:** Slower execution, but easier to debug.\n",
        "* **Compiled:** Faster execution, but requires compilation before running.\n",

        "2 . What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Exception handling is a way to handle runtime errors in Python using `try`, `except`, `finally`, and `else` blocks. It prevents the program from crashing and allows us to deal with errors properly.\n",

        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "The `finally` block is used to write code that must run whether an exception occurs or not. For example, closing a file after reading.\n",

        "4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",

        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",

        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **try block** – Code that may raise an error.\n",
        "2. **except block** – Handles the error.\n",
        "3. **else block** – Runs if no error occurs.\n",
        "4. **finally block** – Runs always (cleanup).\n",

        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Python uses **reference counting** (counts how many variables point to an object). If count = 0, object is deleted. It also uses a **garbage collector** to remove cyclic references.\n",
